Reflect on the theory of affine transformations and viewing transformations by doing the following:

1. List the transformation matrices that you used in Parts 1 and 2 (use general expressions rather than concrete numbers).
A transformation Matrix is a matrix that is in charge of rotating, scaling and translating the object on a given plane.
In part one the main transformation we made was to shift the perspective so it will become an Orthographic perspective. using the default projection matrix which is an identity matrix.

In part two we had multiple transformation matrix, first we have the projection matrix (that mimics the effect of a typical camera), then we have the translation matrix that helps us position the cube on the plane and we have the scale matrix  scales the matrix
